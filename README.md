3D Render - AI-Generated Primitive Shapes

Overview

This project is a 3D renderer that utilizes ChatGPT to generate STL files based on user input of primitive shapes (e.g., cube, sphere, cylinder). The generated STL file is then parsed and rendered into an animation. The system provides a seamless pipeline from text-based shape generation to 3D visualization.

Features

AI-Powered Shape Generation: Uses ChatGPT to process user input and generate STL files.

Supports Common Primitives: Cubes, triangular prisms, and more.

STL File Parsing: Efficiently reads and processes STL files.

3D Rendering: Visualizes the generated model in an animated scene.

Animation Support: Rotates and transforms the model for dynamic visualization.
